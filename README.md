* This is my website for the Dali Lab application!
* I have used fullpage.js forked from github, but the rest is all my work.
* Images taken from the internet or created in photoshop/ illustrator by myself

####Website features
* On the hobbies page, hover over images for them to change color and have a description appear
* On the previous experience page, click on the logos to have them move. Note that you must unclick the logo and move everything back before clicking a new logo

I hope to be considered for the DALI lab Winter 2018.
Thank you so much for your time reading my application!
